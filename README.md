# Python Implementation of BLS12-381

This repository provides a Python implementation of the BLS12-381 pairing-friendly elliptic curve construction, inspired by the original Rust implementation.

## Acknowledgments

The core functionality and design of this Python implementation are based on the work of the original author of the Rust library, which can be found at [Rust BLS12-381 on Crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/bls12_381). I extend my gratitude to the original author for his great contribution to the field.
